        Made from puff pastry in a crescent shape. It is a buttery, flaky,
        viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but
        using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named
        for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter,
        rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
        sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
        layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads
        have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly
        since antiquity. <br />The modern croissant was developed in the early
        20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the
        kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the
        development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made
        them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor.
        The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French
        response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30â€“40% of the
        croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
        frozen dough. Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in
        many European countries and served as dessert all around the world.
